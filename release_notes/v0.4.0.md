v0.4.0 Release Notes

*Changes since v0.3.0*

* `release commit` now doesn't require you to edit message by default. If you want to edit use `release commit --edit`
* `release tag` now gives you the previous log message as the default tag message (useful in case of release a single-issue/commit)
* `release --version` to print version
