v0.2.0 Release Notes

*Changes since v0.1.1*

- use explicit template file: You can edit the template that is used for new release_notes (it will be created within the folder next time you do release start)
- append when already present (if the file already exists then release start / release prepare will add the commit history to the file rather than just printing it out)
